<h1>DOM touch Event</h1>

<p ontouchmove="myFunction(event)">Touch this paragraph while you do something that will interrupt the event. Different devices will interrupt the touch at different actions, so this example can be difficult to demonstrate, but it is considered good practice to include this event.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This example is for touch devices only.</p>
